### Control Multiple tweens with gsap.timeline().

    - A timeline is used to combine multiple tweens, it animates tweens in sequential order and it doesn't depend of the duration of the previous tween.
    - We can pause, restart and reverse the timeline.
    - timeScale we can increase or decrease the time.
        - A value greater than 0 increase the speed animation.

### Adding defaults to clean up timeline animations.

    - Default properties that would be inherited for all tweens.
    - We can write the same properties for a group of tweens.

### Change an animation with built-in eases.

    - In the website we can find the GreenSock Ease Visualizer, to see how the animation is performed.
    - There are different kind of ease, we can pick what we want.
